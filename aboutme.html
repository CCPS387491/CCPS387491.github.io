    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working on becoming better at crocheting, I began crocheting in the beginning of the 2022, and ever since I've been trying to crochet things to get myself better at it. I'm also working hard on my tennis skills.
I am working towards this goal by watching YouTube videos on crocheting and working on my pieces at home for 3 hours. I practice tennis every 4 days a week in order to have progress, in order to play for the school.  
I consider wanting to become a professional at crocheting and tennis as most necessary for my success.
I hope to accomplish on passing and graduating in school, Naples High School, and becoming a "professional" at crochet.
I want to be known for my good grades and awesome ability at math. I want people to come up to me for help if they are stuck in a problem in math.</p>
